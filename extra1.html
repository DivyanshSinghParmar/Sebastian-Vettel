            <h3>Comparison</h3>
            <p>Vettel's unexpected win at the 2008 Italian Grand Prix led the media to dub him the "Baby Schumi". He was not just dubbed this for his nationality but also because of his driving style, his concentration and the hands-on role he plays behind the scenes with his team of engineers. Vettel played down the comparison stating he wanted to be the "New Vettel"</p>

            <h3>Brilliant since the Start</h3>
            <p>ever since the start vettel was brilliant with the cars and his major being michael schumachar used to interact with young german karting drivers. Seeing how good sebastian was michael was pretty sure of his success in upcoming years...and boy was he right.
                as sebastian excelled to F4 and F3 he was pretty much the game to pay for.

            <h3>Michael's gift</h3>
            <p>In defiance of the ruthlessly competitive persona cultivated over the course of his entire career, Schumacher quite literally stepped aside for the next generation, graciously allowing Vettel to overtake without any resistance, and effectively gifting the young bull enough points to earn his third Formula 1 world championship. </p>
            <br><br><br>
            <p><i>"He was a lot quicker and there was no point getting engaged with him"</i>  -Michael Schumacher would offer post-race.</p>
            <i>“I didn’t see the point so that’s why I moved over and let him through.”</i>
            <p><i>“I’m proud of him. He’s a good friend of mine.”</i></p>
            <br><br>
            <p><i>“He was my hero,”</i>Seb Vettel told F1 Racing magazine</p>

            <h3><b>The acccident</b></h3>
            <p>Unfortunately in the december of 2013 michael met an accident while skiing the same year when sebastian had his last championship</p>
            <p><i>"I was as shocked as everybody else in the paddock,"</i>   -Vettel said in a press conference on the first day of testing ahead of the 2014 season in Jerez, southern Spain.</p>
            <br><p><i>"I have known him for a long time and looked up to him my whole life.

                I got to know him better when he made his comeback and we spoke to each other regularly.
                
                We still don't know what shape he will be in when he wakes up, which is awful for his family and friends.
                
                I am still in shock, but hoping the miracle happens and he can be the same guy he was before.
                I'm sure the pressure from the media on the hospital didn't help.

                It is about Michael and his family and it is good for the hospital to be able to focus on their job."</i></p>
