            </p>
            <p>the current 7 time world champion Lewis Hamilton even sometimes fear </p>
            <p>Year, 2008</p>
            <p>The Legendary circuit Monza was experiencing heavy rainfall.
                Many drivers in order to set pole lap on monza were trying their best. 
                last 2 year champions Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Raikonnen were pushing their limits, battling to get the the pricy pole position.
                both drivers loosing control and dnf their qualifying.
                but who knew the young sebastian vettel was gonna nail the qualifying.
                Sebastian vettel got the pole position with the 3rd slowest car in the grid with no experience.

            <img class="monzawin"src="monzawin.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Many thought of this as a beginner's luck. 
                Young seb laughed and took the challenge.
                On the race day, heavy rain accompanied with2 crashes and 2 safety cars, sebastian vettel got his pole position
                and used that position wisely winning the italian GP gracefully.
            </p>
            <p>The sauber finished higher than its own senior team, because of Sebastian</p>
            <p>In 2009, Sebastian got promoted to the senior team Red Bull, it was really interesting and exciting to see what sebastian would now do with the new team. </p>
            <p>In order to bag the title Red Bull knew Sebastianwas the key. </p>
            <p>Red Bull with sebastian gave their all might in hopes of that championship, unfortunately the rookie team Brawn GP was so good and equiped with new tech</p>
            <p>The Red Bull team lost the title fight, but not heir hopes. Red Bull for the first time was now 2nd position on team standing with sebastian on 2nd in drivers standings</p>
            <img class="standings" src="2009standings.png" alt="">
            <p>2010 was the year of Rage fight, the and the driver who ready to gave their all would only win the championship</p>
            <img class="vetalo" src="vettelalonso.jpg" alt="">

            <p>Last race of 2010 championship, Alonso leading with 246 points, webber with 238, vettel with 231, Hamilton with 222. Meaning in order to win the race vettel had to make sure he wins the race plus also hope that alonso does not finish more 5th with webber in the way as well.</p>
            <p>Sebastian took the pole position. Webber being his team mate decided towork as the wingman. </p>
            <p>As the race started, Sebastian got a good start but alonso was right behind his tail. on the first lap michael schumacher spun out got involved in a crash giving a safety car window. </p>
            <img class ="schumicrash" src="schumicrash.jpg" alt="">
            <p>Now, with a new restart vettel charged again. both the teams Red Bull and Ferrari giving their all with the best strategies in mind and rightful play of using teammates a an obstacle. Red Bull using Mark Webber and Ferrari using Felipe Massa.</p>
            <p>Lap 25, Hamilton realised Vettel was already way too ahead and to try for a fight. Vettel's pitstop helped him stay away from hamilton's fight. With 2 pitstops Alonso was way behind but seemed to be having a pace to catch up.</p>
            <p>By the lap 43, on the radio sebastian said "balance is good, i can go faster". Shivering the spine of Ferrari team.Red Bull ordered Sebastian to stay easy in order to protect tires</p>
